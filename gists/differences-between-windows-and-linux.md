Windows and Linux are both popular operating systems used by millions of users worldwide. While they have some similarities, there are several key differences between them:

1. Open-source vs. Proprietary: Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that its source code is freely available for anyone to modify and distribute. Windows, on the other hand, is a proprietary operating system, which means that its source code is owned and controlled by Microsoft, and users are not allowed to modify or distribute it.

2. Cost: Linux is generally free to use, while Windows requires users to purchase a license.

3. User interface: Windows has a graphical user interface (GUI) that is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. Linux also has a GUI, but many users prefer to use the command line interface (CLI) for more advanced tasks.

4. Security: Linux is known for its strong security features, which make it less vulnerable to malware and other security threats. Windows, on the other hand, has historically been more vulnerable to security threats, but Microsoft has made significant strides in recent years to improve its security.

5. Software compatibility: Windows is widely used, and most software is designed to run on it. Linux has a smaller user base, and some software may not be compatible with it.

Key features of Linux:

1. Open-source: Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that its source code is freely available for anyone to modify and distribute.

2. Customizable: Linux is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor their system to their specific needs.

3. Command line interface (CLI): While Linux does have a GUI, many users prefer to use the command line interface (CLI) for more advanced tasks.

4. Security: Linux is known for its strong security features, which make it less vulnerable to malware and other security threats.

5. Stability: Linux is known for its stability, with many servers running for years without needing to be rebooted.

6. Compatibility: While some software may not be compatible with Linux, it is designed to be compatible with a wide range of hardware and software platforms.

In summary, Linux and Windows are two very different operating systems, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Linux is an open-source, customizable, and secure operating system that is designed for advanced users who prefer to use the command line interface. Windows is a proprietary, user-friendly operating system that is designed for mainstream users who prefer to use a graphical user interface.
