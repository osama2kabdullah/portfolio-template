To install Redshift on your CrunchBang++ machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file is located.

2. Extract the contents of the tarball by running the following command:

```bash
tar -xzvf redshift-1.12.tar.gz
```

3. Change into the newly created directory:

```bash
cd redshift-1.12/
```

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool automake autopoint gettext intltool libgps-dev
```

5. Compile and install Redshift:
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```

6. Once the installation is complete, you can run Redshift by entering the following command in the terminal:
```bash
redshift
```
You can customize the settings of Redshift by creating a configuration file in your home directory named ".config/redshift.conf". The configuration file can contain various options such as the latitude and longitude of your location, the color temperature of the screen, and more. You can find more information about the available options in the Redshift manual page by running `man redshift`.
